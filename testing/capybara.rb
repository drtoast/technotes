# capybara (browser testing) - https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara

# WebRat replacement that runs JavaScript
# Driver Agnostic (switch seamlessly)
#   rack-test (fast, simple, but no JavaScript)
#   Selenium (real browser, but slow, requires GUI)
#   HTMLUnit (headless, good JavaScript support, but slow)
#     Celerity/Culerity/Akephalos
#   Envjs (headless, faster than HTMLUnit, but JavaScript and CSS not 100%)
